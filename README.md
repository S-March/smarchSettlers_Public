I freaking love boardgames. I also, happen to love making things. I figured why not make a s fancy shmancy Settlers of Catan board.

When you plug the board in, it randomly generates the layout of the commodities. Additionally, it randomly generating the number tokens for them!

When you press the button on the side, it randomly rolls the dice (according to dice odds, aka a 6 is four times more likely to be rolled than a 12).

I hope you enjoy!
